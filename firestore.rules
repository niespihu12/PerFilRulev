/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for PerFinRule application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has full control over their profile, transactions, and category rules.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring clear ownership:
 *   - /users/{userId}: User profile information.
 *   - /users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}: Financial transactions.
 *   - /users/{userId}/category_rules/{categoryRuleId}: Rules for categorizing transactions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data. There is no administrative override.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed to prevent data exposure.
 * - Transactions and category rules inherit ownership from their parent user document.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The data model inherently denormalizes the `userId` by nesting data under `/users/{userId}`.
 * This allows for rules that directly compare `request.auth.uid` to the `userId` path parameter, avoiding costly `get()` operations.
